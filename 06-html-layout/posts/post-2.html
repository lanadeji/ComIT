          People are moving to Austin, Texas, for many reasons: the glorious weather, the warmth and friendliness of the people, the promising job market and the one-of-a-kind culture. You can’t go wrong with planting roots in the live music capital of the world. On average, around 100 people move to Austin every day—and for good reason. Centered in the heart of Texas, the city has recently transformed from a sleepy college town to one of the largest, most vibrant cities in the U.S. Austin was even ranked as the number one best place to live on U.S. News’ Best Places to Live in the USA list. So what are you waiting for? Whether you’re relocating for a career or family, or you simply want to experience Austin’s creativity and coolness for yourself, the capital city is waiting for you. Here’s everything you need to know about moving to Austin, TX.<br />
          The weather in Austin is beautiful, but the heat definitely takes some getting used to. The warmest days occur in August, when temperatures average around 98°F. It’s not unheard of for temperatures to rise well above 100°F, with the city’s hottest day on record reaching 112°F. Throughout the year, the metro area experiences fairly mild weather. However, to survive the city’s blasing-hot summers, you’ll need air conditioning and a map of all the best simming holes and spring-fed pools in the Austin area.

          The heart of Austin beats in the Downtown area. If you’re someone who loves dining, live music and elegant condo living, Downtown is the place for you. While it comes with a hefty price tag, the downtown area is the cultural epicenter of it all. Here you’ll find a plethora of well-known restaurants, buzzworthy bars on Rainey Street and beyond, the Red River Cultural District, bustling Sixth Street and tons of apartments and condos to choose from. Running through the heart of the city is Lady Bird Lake, which offers plenty of activities in the form of canoes, paddle boats and over 10 miles of hike-and-bike trails and lovely views. Whether you’re an outdoor enthusiast, a foodie, a live music fanatic or someone who appreciates an urban stroll, you’ll love being able to call downtown Austin home.

          North Austin is a great choice for those looking to be out of the suburbs, but who still prefer proximity to the downtown area. Residents can still reap the benefits of the downtown vibe without the high costs. If you’re relocating to Austin, you’ll want to get familiar with the most popular spots in the North Austin area such as North Loop and Anderson Lane. Here you’ll find strips of brightly colored buildings, award-winning breweries, restaurants, bars and vintage shops with locally sourced goods. Step into Room Service Vintage for funky home decor, relax with a good book at Cherrywood Coffeehouse, and enjoy a late-night live blues performance at the legendary Skylark lounge. Idyllic homes range from single-story houses to modern apartment complexes within walking distance of plenty of fun activities and entertainment. This area is relatively affordable (for Austin!) which makes it such a desirable place to live.

          Over the last decade, East Austin has rapidly transformed into one of the city’s trendiest, most diverse neighborhoods. As one of the fastest-growing areas in Austin, the eclectic East Side offers a balance of culture and rich history mixed with new, vibrant bars, eateries and shops. East 6th Street is bursting with personality and flavor: Try the famous Don Juan taco at Juan in a Million, go two-stepping at The White Horse (a hipster honky-tonk), sip mezcal cocktails at Whisler’s, and check out the exciting collection of art galleries and studios, like Canopy and grayDUCK. East Austin is where you’ll find hipster urban development at its finest. For those who appreciate walkability, food trucks and endless coffee shops and bars, it’s the perfect place to settle down. The area is still up-and-coming, although rent has skyrocketed-now is the time to search for homes before it becomes more expensive. The further north and east you travel, the more family-friendly the area becomes. East Austin also boasts proximity to downtown and major highways, including I-35.

          South Austin is a veritable melting pot of old-school Austin and new, trendy establishments, with a family-friendly atmosphere and numerous places to explore. While the roads are fairly narrow and congested most of the time, you’ll never run out of fun things to do in South Austin. South Congress (SoCo) is a popular strip of restaurants, music, entertainment and shopping. This is where Austinites take out-of-towners, to try on cowboy boots at Allen’s Boots, shop for Mexican folk art, chow down on tacos at Guero’s, and get super-charged on iced turbos at Jo’s Coffee. You’ll also find that locals in this area tend to stay south of Lady Bird Lake, which draws a boundary between North and South Austin. South Austin has recently seen tremendous growth while being able to keep its “Keep Austin Weird” feel. This area of Austin is where people from all around the globe prefer to live. Home and apartment prices in this area are on the expensive end, but prices will become more affordable as you travel south.

          If you prefer to live in the picturesque countryside with gorgeous rolling hills, West Austin is definitely the neighborhood for you. If you drive down loop 360, you’ll experience more of Austin’s natural, lush beauty as opposed to skyscrapers and bumper-to-bumper traffic. This wealthy and reputable area offers breathtaking views, great schools, golf courses and plenty of residential developments. Homes range from beautiful Victorians to rolling estates. West Austin is also home to two different lakes, Lake Travis and Lake Austin, which bring in more expensive real estate for buyers versus renters. West Austin is popular among families who prefer to be by the lake, and it’s a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of the big city.
